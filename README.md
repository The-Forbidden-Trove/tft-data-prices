These are Path of Exile pricing data crunched from our Discord Server and generate outputs to TFT pricing channels. Most of the data are only available exclusively from TFT such as
- Services (betrayal benchcrafts, temple benchcrafts)
- Compasses (Sextant mod)
- Heist Contracts
- Other prices in **BULK**
- etc


## Folder Explanation

- `lsc` - League Softcore
- `std` - Standard Softcore

## Timestamp Format

- they are in epoch time
- equivalent to JavaScript's `Date.now()`

## Changes to names of prices

The display name used to present the prices are subject to change. For example - if there are any new services or item name changes made by GGG that conflict with an existing name, the display name will also be changed on our Discord.

The file paths are subject to change if and when there are any channel changes made in the TFT Discord. 
Recent changes for example being that bulk Simulacrum prices file path changed from `bulk-others.json` to `bulk-simulacrum.json`. This was because a new Simulacrum channel was added due to the changes made by GGG for the 3.17 league.
